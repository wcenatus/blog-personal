**VISA ALLOCATION:  FRAUD AND AUTHORZATION DATA DISPUTES**

VISA VCR Allocation is a dispute process that was put in place on 15th April 2018. VISA reviews data and documentation submitted by an issuer for dispute. Based on the data, VISA can assign liability to the merchant or reject the issuer’s claim. If a merchant is assessed liability, the merchant may respond to the dispute via a pre-arbitration or accept the case. All disputes must be responded to regardless if the reply is an acceptance or a rebuttal with the intent to contest.  Any case that does not receive a response will have an $0.85 cent fee applied.

**VISA COLLABORATION: CONSUMER AND PROCESSING ERROR DISPUTES**

VISA VCR Collaboration is a dispute process that was put in place on 15th April 2018. This system is similar to the dispute process that was in place prior to VCR. The issuer files a dispute on behalf of their cardholder through VISA system to the Acquirer, and the dispute is passed onto the intended merchant.  A merchant may contest the dispute via a re-presentment or accept it. All disputes must be responded to regardless if the reply is an acceptance or a rebuttal with the intent to contest.  Any case that does not receive a response will have an $0.85 cent fee applied.
