There was a time, not long ago, when point-of-sale (POS) systems were almost exclusively for large, well-funded businesses. Large retail operations had the staff and funding to develop or buy such systems, as well as maintain and update them. This meant that the many added features that made a point-of-sale system so valuable were only available to large businesses.

Today, the reach of the point-of-sale system has changed. Turnkey options and customizability mean that POS systems are available to businesses of every size. And yet there are still huge numbers or sellers nationwide that have barebones terminals or even remain cash-only.

Business of all sizes in every industry can benefit from a point-of-sale system, but many don’t realize why. Here’s how the landscape has changed, and why every business can benefit from a point-of-sale system.

### **The Benefits Are Clear**

It’s always been clear that there were huge benefits to well-made point-of-sale systems, but the question was previously an economic one — did the benefits outweigh the costs?

The main benefit of a point-of-sale system is how much it can simplify your business operation. When small business owners start up, they are often surprised at how much of their time is taken up by tasks that are well beyond their core expertise.

A good point-of-sale system can simplify or, in some cases, go well beyond merely accepting payments and virtually eliminate those tasks. A modern point-of-sale system can help with inventory, time-clock and employee management, taxes, discounts and pricing, and more.

The landscape is far different than it was a decade ago, when only large businesses could afford a point-of-sale system. Now, more businesses can afford and benefit from a point-of-sale system to make life easier for themselves, their customers, and their employees.

### **The Economics Have Changed**

So while the capabilities and power of a point-of-sale system have long been undeniable, the economics of the purchase could not be justified by SMBs.

Times have changed. point-of-sale system prices are now far lower, which has made the tools that were once exclusively available to retail giants affordable for even small businesses.

Today POS systems come in various models, ensuring that a business doesn’t have to pay for a machine that gives them functionality they’ll never use.

### **POS Companies Know: One Size Does Not Fit All**

A major benefit to modern POS systems is that they are often customizable. A one-location food truck, for instance, does not need the same tools as a major nationwide retail chain, yet in the past, this was often irrelevant as POS providers offered the same tools to everyone.

Today, you can find a mobile solution that fits your specific needs. Some point-of-sale options prioritize mobility while some prioritize organization among multiple locations. Some are created for restaurants while others cater to healthcare. But an SMB no longer needs to overpay for features they will never use—now, they have options available that cater to their unique circumstances.

### **Modern POS Systems Are Simple and Intuitive**

Historically, point-of-sale system systems were too complex for a small business to bother with. The truly simple options were a cash register and maybe a card terminal, but anything more often caused headaches and constant service and troubleshooting calls.

Years of refinement have solved this problem. Today’s point-of-sale system are simple and easy-to-use, designed not for internal experts at the point-of-sale system company, but everyday workers. They update simply via the cloud and offer an intuitive user experience.

### **Something For Everyone**

The technological tools once available only to the giants of retail are now available to all businesses. Modern point-of-sale system offer both powerful payment acceptance and other value-added features all in packages that are affordable to businesses of any size.

This technology makes life simpler and business easier. The POS landscape has changed, and today’s systems have something to offer every business.
