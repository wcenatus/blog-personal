Washington, Feb. 9, 2016 – In response to comments from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today that Internet sales tax legislation would be considered by the chamber during the current session of Congress, NRF Senior Vice President for Government Relations David French said:

“Retailers applaud e-fairness champions Sens. Dick Durbin, Lamar Alexander, Mike Enzi and Heidi Heitkamp for continuing to push for action on removing the government-imposed sales tax advantage that Internet sellers enjoy. Leader McConnell’s plan to work with his colleagues to facilitate a Senate vote on e-fairness legislation this year is a promising step forward, and it helps to ensure that the important Customs conference report can now proceed in the Senate. Retailers across America urge Congress to finish the job on e-fairness before more Main Street businesses are forced to close their doors due to unfair tax preferences.”
