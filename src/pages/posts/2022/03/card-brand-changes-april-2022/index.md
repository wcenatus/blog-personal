The Card Brands recently announced that there will be some new fees as well as significant changes to certain rate and fee categories starting in April 2022.  MasterCard will no longer bill an Account Status Inquiry Service Fee or a CVC2 Transaction Fee, however there will be an increase in the Digital Enablement Fee. MasterCard is introducing a new Decline Reason Service Code fee for any card transaction that is declined.  Visa is introducing a new Issuer Will Never Approve Reattempt Fee for transactions that are permanently declined.  Both Visa and Discover will be implementing a new Address Verification Service Fee. In addition, American Express will be introducing a new OptBlue Transaction Fee as well as increasing its OptBlue Assessment Fee.  As always, CWA does its best to ensure that its merchant portfolio is materially impacted when the Card Brands announce pricing changes, however, due to the nature of the changes described above, CWA will be making some modifications to certain pricing structures.  For merchants that are priced on a tiered pricing schedule, rates will be increased 6bps for all qualified transactions, 14bps for all mid-qualified transactions, and 22bps for all non-qualified transactions (28bps for 5967/7273 classified merchants).  For cost plus priced merchants, any surcharged transaction that you process will be increased by 3bps. Please visit the Card Brand sites to see a list of their interchange rates and other fees and expenses that they charge to merchants.
