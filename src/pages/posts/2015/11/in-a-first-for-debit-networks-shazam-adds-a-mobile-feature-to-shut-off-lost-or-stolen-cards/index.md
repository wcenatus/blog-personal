In the wake of the arrival of EMV chip cards and ahead of the holiday shopping rush, the Shazam debit network has launched a mobile feature that lets cardholders disable their debit cards should they be lost or stolen.

While networks like Discover Financial Services have advertised a similar feature for credit cards, the new Shazam feature, which is part of its Bolts mobile app, is the first of its kind for a debit network, a spokesman for the network tells Digital Transactions News. “You just click a button and \[the card\] is off,” he says. “It’s attractive for consumers and financial institutions because that’s less fraud for them.”

Since the service went live at the end of September, it has blocked some 600 Shazam cards. As the holiday-shopping season approaches, the network expects many more will be switched off as cardholders lose their cards in the shopping frenzy. “As the volume goes higher seasonally, it stands to reason there’s more potential” for lost-and-stolen fraud, says the spokesman.

The feature, whose formal name is Bolts Transaction Control, is rolling out to the network’s 1,300 member financial institutions and is one of three services available for Bolts, a mobile app Johnston, Iowa-based Shazam launched in January 2013. The other two are transaction alerts and peer-to-peer payments, a service Shazam added this summer.

So far, about half of the Shazam members have integrated Bolts and have added Transaction Control. Those banks account for some 1.3 million debit cards out of the network’s total of 4.9 million active Shazam-bugged cards. Of these, just over half a million are now active on the new service.
