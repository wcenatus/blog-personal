Datacap Systems, a leading integrated payments middleware provider, has completed US EMV level 3 certification with TSYS and has released an EMV-capable version of NETePay™ that’s available for download today. NETePay for TSYS provides PC-based point of sale providers with the ability to deliver US EMV functionality via an evolving list of PIN Pads and simple out-of-scope interface.

NETePay for TSYS supports host-based tip adjustment for US EMV transactions, making it ideal for bar and restaurant applications. The initial release of NETePay for TSYS is certified to utilize the VX 805 PIN Pad from Verifone that supports EMV, MSR, PIN and NFC contactless transactions. Additional hardware options supporting mobility and point to point encryption will be available as Datacap completes queued device certifications.

“We’re excited to announce our latest US EMV certification with TSYS,” commented Justin Zeigler, marketing director at Datacap Systems. “Perfect for table-service restaurants, the host-based TSYS Summit platform supports US EMV tip adjustment and tokens so merchants can continue to handle gratuities without forcing the update to mobile devices.”

This release adds yet another processing option to Datacap’s current EMV-certified versions of NETePay which to date include Mercury, Vantiv, Paymentech, Sterling Payment, First Data Rapid Connect and TSYS, with more to follow. In advance of the release of Datacap’s Tran™ apps, embedded POS providers can utilize Datacap’s PDC™ to communicate with an EMV-enabled version of in-store NETePay today.
